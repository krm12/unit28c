<p><b>What is Fake news?</b>
Lots of things you read online especially in your social media feeds may appear to be true, often is not. Fake news are stories or hoaxes created to deliberately misinform or deceive readers. Usually, these stories are created to either influence people’s views, push a political agenda or cause confusion and can often be a profitable business for online publishers. False information can deceive people by looking like trusted websites or using similar names and web addresses to reputable news organisations.</p>

<p>There are differing opinions when it comes to identifying types of false information. However, when it comes to evaluating content online there are various types of false or misleading news we need to be aware of. These include clickbait, parody, propaganda and sloppy journalism.
Fake news can have damaging implications on society and MPs are concerned about it. In recent months, Whatsapp has been forced to make changes to its platform to show that messages have been forwarded from another user. The changes come in response to a series of videos shared that caused people to attack others. The Indian government is now looking at measures to tackle fake news - including making it possible to trace the origins of messages shared on end-to-end encrypted messaging apps like Whatsapp.</p>
